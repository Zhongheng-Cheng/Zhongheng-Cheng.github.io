# Introduction

Welcome to my blog! I am Zhongheng Cheng, a master's student pursuing computer engineering at Columbia University. I have vast interest in **Machine Learning** and **Large Language Models**. Therefore, I feel genuinely excited to have the opportunity to contribute to Red Hen Lab as a participant of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024, to push forward the study of frame blending in this LLMs era with collective effort.

This blog is for a weekly document of progress for the **Frame Blending by LLMs** project of **Red Hen Lab, GSoC 2024**.
