### Generate Examples with Llama 2 - Zero-shot

It seems that llama2 react poorly to the zero-shot prompting, because it is not really _blending_ the frames, but just _using_ the frames.

### Generate Examples with Llama 2 - One-shot

Here, I provided a example, "**Time is money.**", to let llama2 understand more the intended output. Also, the **chain of thought** (input space - cross-space mapping - blended space analysis) is provided in the example so that llama2 can have a similar train of thought when generating the output.

"**Health is wealth.**", generated by llama2.

"**He is worth millions.**", generated by llama2.

Additionally, I asked llama2 to generate an example blending the frame "physics" and the frame "family", here is the result:

"**The kids were running wild in the house like energy is loose.**"

### RAG with Llama-index

Without RAG, when we ask llama2 about specific questions about the FrameNet dataset, it would reply with seemingly related content, but not exactly consistent with FrameNet dataset. That would be an issue when we want to generate frame blending examples align with FrameNet dataset.

Therefore, I built a llama-index application, taking the directory that contains all the `.xml` frame files as the input, and replying frame-specific questions with solid reference.

Now the reply aligns with the content of the `Execute_plan` frame in the FrameNet dataset.
