### Deploying Llama 2

Deployed Llama 2 on HPC and used it to generate simple frame blending examples with prompting. Detailed process can be found [here](https://github.com/Zhongheng-Cheng/gsoc2024-frame-blending/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#gsoc2024-frame-blending).

## Other Messages From The Weekly Meeting

- It is a tough linguistic question to distinguish from "using frames" and "blending frames". We want to have a system that **blends** frames.
- When prompting, we could try one-shot/few-shot prompting.
- For generating results, we will manually check it first.

## To-do List For Next Week

- Generate frame blending examples with prompts
    - Directly generate an example of frame blending - randomly picking up frames.
    - Generate examples of frame blending based on two or multiple given frames.
- Try to develop RAG tools for Llama 2 to enhance the data-retrieval ability to FrameNet data.
- Continue studying the full annotation of FrameNet.
- Read the reading materials provided by Professor Turner, and share my understanding next week.
