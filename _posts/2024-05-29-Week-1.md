## Finished

- Studied [CWRU HPC Orientation](https://sites.google.com/a/case.edu/hpcc/home?authuser=1), including:
    - graphical access
    - work nodes requesting
    - job scheduling and submitting
    - etc.
- Got familiar with FrameNet dataset, including:
    - [FrameNet online dataset](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/)
    - local dataset stored on HPC 
        - /mnt/rds/redhen/gallina/projects/ChattyAI/FramesConstructions/fndata-1.7
- Learned about available open-source LLM models, including:
    - [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
    - [Llama 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)
- Started thinking about fine-tuning methods and RAG

## Other Messages From The Weekly Meeting

- Before working onto something bigger, finish something smaller but **works**. Make every step steady so as to build a successful project.
- FrameNet is **limited** (e.g. no frames examples for tourism), 

## Challenges

- What would be the proportion of fine-tuning and RAG?
- How to build the evaluation matrix / how to assess the accuracy of the generated result?
    - How to build the system so that it doesn't just randomly throw 2 frames together in a terrible way that everyone would think it is a disaster?


<!-- ## Frame blending

Different kinds of conceptual integration involving frames:

- Simplex networks
- Mirror networks
- Single-scope networks
- Double-scope networks

Question: 

- Does the model need to be prompted to generate specific kind of frame blending?
- How to Identify and classify the generated type of frame blending?

## LLM

Three types of architecture:

- Encoder-only
    - tagging, classifying, ...
- Decoder-only
    - generating (text, dialogue, creative content), ...
    - Llama 2/3, GPT series, Mistral, 
- Encoder-decoder
    - translating, 

Encoders can view a whole input sequence regardless of direction (can see left to right or right to left at any given time)
Decoders can only proceed sequentially (can only see left to right up to the point that they are currently at) -->
